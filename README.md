# Counter_-_Todo_List
Built a Flutter project to learn state management and persistent data storage using setState and SharedPreferences. Developed a counter app with saved state and a to-do list app that stores tasks locally. This project enhanced my skills in managing UI state and saving data for a better user experience.
